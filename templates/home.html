    <p class="Morsepara">Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal duration called dots and dashes.
        In our project we have implemented two features. First one is where we convert string to morse code and the second one is converting morse code to string.
        We used morse code conversion in our project because morse code contains dots and dashes which can easily represented in a binary tree.
        In the binary tree which we contstructed the left traversal represent dots and the right traversal represent dash. For example,</p>
     <p> </p>
     <p class="Morsepara">
        <br>
        a) -.... represents 6
        <br>
        b) .-.. represents L
        <br>
        c) ..-. represents F
     </p>
